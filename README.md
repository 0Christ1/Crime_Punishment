# Overview
Our database-driven website offers a platform that enables users to efficiently manage data with functionalities like retrieving, adding, updating, deleting, and sorting. It supports multiple users, allowing concurrent database manipulation without interference. At the application level, we ensure robust security by verifying user credentials, protecting sensitive information from general access, and implementing auto-logout after 15 minutes. Additionally, our approach includes encrypting sensitive data in the database and designing tables to store information in a general format, enhancing security by avoiding the storage of highly sensitive details.
